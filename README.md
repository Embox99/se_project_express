# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This repository contains the backend server for the "WTWR" project, a weather-based clothing recommendation application. The server is built with Express.js and MongoDB, providing a robust API for managing users, clothing items, and user interactions such as likes.

## Project Description

The "WTWR" project is designed to help users decide what to wear based on the weather. Users can create and manage their profiles, add clothing items to their collections, and get suggestions based on current weather conditions. The backend server handles all the data processing and storage, serving as the backbone of the application.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: The runtime environment used to build the backend server.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to set up the server and manage routing.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data and clothing items.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
- ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript, helping to maintain consistent code quality.
- Nodemon: A utility that automatically restarts the server when file changes are detected, improving the development workflow.
- Validator: A library used for validating and sanitizing inputs, particularly URLs in this project.
